Shiva
=====

A seven-hand poker clone. If you've used MSN/Live Messenger, you know what I mean.

Shiva is open-source software, written in Java. Let's say Modified BSD License for now.

We use a highly-modular development scheme, where functionality is encapsulated as abstractly as possible.

This allows us to genericize the use of card-game classes in order to maximize code re-use.

We also aim to use javadoc and JUnit, targeting Java 6 and higher.
